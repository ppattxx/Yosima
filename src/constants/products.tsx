        As a passionate graphic designer specializing in social media design,
        I have had the opportunity to work on a range of creative projects that
        focus on enhancing the digital presence of brands through visually engaging
        and strategically crafted content. My goal is to help businesses communicate
        their values, connect with their audience, and build a strong visual identity
        that feels both authentic and impactful in today&apos;s fast paced online environment.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the years, I have collaborated with several brands on both professional
        and academic levels. One of the projects I&apos;m most proud of was
        for FIFA Gym Sidoarjo, a local fitness center. I was responsible for
        designing their Instagram visuals to reflect a high energy, motivational,
        and professional tone. Through the use of bold typography, strong imagery,
        and a consistent content structure, I helped shape their brand into one that
        felt both approachable and inspiring for their target audience—primarily fitness enthusiasts in the local area.

        Another notable project was for Glowstep, a modern shoe cleaning service.
        Here, I developed a clean, minimalist, and fresh visual identity tailored
        to appeal to a younger demographic. The design direction emphasized trust,
        clarity, and modernity, which aligned with Glowstep&apos;s brand values. I focused
        on building a visual system that could easily be applied across their Instagram
        feed, helping them stand out in a competitive and trend driven market.

        As part of my academic journey in graphic design, I had the opportunity to create
        a series of three commercial posters that allowed me to explore how design
        communicates value, emotion, and identity in the real market. 
        These projects were designed for two different brands: New Era, 
        a global lifestyle and fashion brand, and Glowstep, a local shoe cleaning service. 
        Even though these were university assignments, I approached each project with a 
        professional mindset, simulating the creative process used in real client work.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
        For New Era, I designed two different poster concepts that reflect the brand&apos;s bold, 
        urban, and youthful energy. I focused on creating strong visual compositions with 
        dynamic typography, striking imagery, and a color palette that resonated with the brand&apos;s 
        streetwear culture. Each poster was crafted to appeal to the brand&apos;s target audience—young 
        individuals who express themselves through fashion, sports, and culture. The goal was to 
        maintain New Era&apos;s premium feel while still delivering fresh and trend forward visuals 
        that could be used in print or digital campaigns.
        </p>{" "}        
        <p>
        The third commercial poster was created for Glowstep, a modern shoe cleaning service 
        targeting younger, style conscious consumers. For this poster, I emphasized clean layouts, 
        minimal design elements, and soft yet vibrant colors to reflect hygiene, freshness, 
        and a sense of trust. The goal was to build a visual language that could strengthen Glowstep&apos;s 
        identity as both reliable and modern, helping it stand out in a market filled with similar services.

        In addition to my work as a social media designer, I also have hands on experience 
        in content creation, where I&apos;ve been involved not only in the ideation process but 
        also in the execution—from scripting and design to being the talent on camera. 
        My content creation work combines creative thinking, strategic storytelling, and 
        strong visual understanding to deliver content that resonates with audiences and 
        stays true to each brand&apos;s identity.{" "}

        One of my key experiences was with PT Tiga Pilar Nutrisi, where I was responsible for 
        developing content ideas and also appeared as a talent in the content itself. 
        This dual role allowed me to better understand how messaging translates both 
        on screen and behind the scenes, giving me a more holistic approach to content strategy.

        I also took charge of content creation for FIFA Gym, where I handled the entire 
        process—from conceptualizing content ideas and writing the copy to designing the 
        visuals and optimizing posts for engagement. My goal was to maintain consistency 
        while keeping the content energetic, motivating, and aligned with the gym&apos;s brand voice. 
        Through this, I learned to balance creativity with the fitness industry&apos;s fast paced demands.
